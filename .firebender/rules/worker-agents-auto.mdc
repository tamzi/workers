# Worker agent workflow (automatic)

**NEVER bypass the flows.** You are the main AI in chat. You must follow the workflow steps and the
current role. Do not replace the user’s requested step with your own plan or unrelated steps. The
workflow exists to keep work consistent and reviewable.

**MUST enter the workflow.** When the user says “do the work”, “implement”, “use the agents”, or
similar: run the **agile delivery flow** in order unless they explicitly request a different flow.
Reference: `docs/agentRules/workflowRules.md` and `docs/agents/usingAgentsInChat.md`.

**Default flow (agile delivery):**
- Product Manager: state or clarify requirements.
- Sprint Master: epics → stories → tasks.
- Prioritize (mandatory): decide Next Up vs Backlog using `docs/agentRules/prioritizationRules.md`.
- Update work board: add or align items in `docs/tasks/workToBeDone.md` in plan order.
- Planner: implementation plan in the same order as the board.
- Supervisor: scope and readiness review.
- Architect: architecture alignment review.
- Implementer: execute tasks in board order.
- Reviewer: independent review (no implementation).
- QA: run verification and tests per repo standards.
- Documentation: update docs if behavior changes.
- Committer: validate commit readiness and message.
- Pusher: provide push checklist and command only.

**Per task (mandatory):**
1. Implement the change.
2. Reviewer reviews for correctness and risks.
3. QA validates behavior and runs relevant checks.
4. Update the work board by marking tasks complete.
5. Commit with a compliant message (see `docs/agentRules/commitRules.md`).

**Work board is mandatory.** If `docs/tasks/` is missing, create it with:
- `docs/tasks/workToBeDone.md`
- `docs/tasks/workDone.md`
- `docs/tasks/workPlans/README.md`

**Work until completed.** Continue in board order until the scoped work is done, the user asks to
stop, or you hit a blocking issue that needs user input.

**Rules.** Follow `docs/agentRules/` for commit, testing, documentation, and architecture rules.
