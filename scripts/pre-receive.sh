# Server-side pre-receive hook: Enforce commit rules on the remote
#
# INSTALLATION (on remote repository):
#   cp scripts/pre-receive /path/to/remote/repo.git/hooks/pre-receive
#   chmod +x /path/to/remote/repo.git/hooks/pre-receive
#
# PURPOSE:
# This is the ULTIMATE DEFENSE against --no-verify bypasses.
# Client-side hooks (pre-commit, pre-push) can be bypassed with --no-verify,
# but server-side hooks CANNOT be bypassed - they run on the server.
#
# WHEN IT RUNS: On the server, after receiving push but before updating refs
# CANNOT BE BYPASSED: Users cannot use --no-verify to skip this
#
# This validates ALL commits being pushed follow the rules in docs/agentRules/commitRules.md

set -euo pipefail  # Exit on error, undefined vars, and pipe failures

# Color codes for terminal output

GREEN='\033[0;32m'
