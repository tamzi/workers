# Pre-push hook: Validate commit rules and run code quality checks
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS:
# - Ensures all commits follow the documented commit rules
# - Catches bugs and code quality issues before they reach the remote repository
# - Prevents breaking CI builds that waste time and resources
# - Provides faster feedback (seconds locally vs minutes waiting for CI)
# - Reduces "fix CI" commits that clutter git history
# - Acts as a safety net for all developers
#
# PHILOSOPHY: "Shift left" - find issues as early as possible in the dev cycle
#
# WHEN IT RUNS: Automatically before every `git push`
# BYPASSING: Using `git push --no-verify` is FORBIDDEN
#            See docs/agentRules/commitRules.md for the strict policy
#            Fix your commits instead of bypassing the checks

# TODO: Re-enable tests once Gradle test configuration is fixed
# test \

# WHY THESE SPECIFIC CHECKS:
#
# 1. detekt - Static analysis for Kotlin code
#    - Catches potential bugs, code smells, and style violations
#    - Enforces consistent code patterns across the team
#    - Fast to run, high signal-to-noise ratio
#
# 2. test - All unit tests
#    - Verifies functionality isn't broken
#    - Ensures new changes don't break existing features
#    - Unit tests are fast (run in seconds)
#
# WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED (intentionally):
# - Instrumented tests (too slow, better suited for CI)
# - Full builds (checked by CI, too time-consuming for every push)
# - Coverage reports (generated in CI, not needed locally every time)
#
# PERFORMANCE TUNING:
# --no-daemon    : Prevents gradle daemon from lingering after checks
# --max-workers=4: Limits parallel tasks to avoid overwhelming your machine
# -q             : Quiet mode, only shows warnings/errors for faster output
