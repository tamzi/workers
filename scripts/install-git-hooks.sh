#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Script to install Git hooks for the project
#
# PURPOSE:
# This installer sets up automated quality gates that run at specific points
# in your git workflow to catch issues early and maintain code quality.
#
# WHY WE USE GIT HOOKS:
# 1. Catch issues locally before they reach CI (faster feedback)
# 2. Prevent broken builds from blocking other developers
# 3. Enforce consistent commit message standards
# 4. Reduce code review noise by catching style/quality issues early
# 5. Validate commit history follows project rules
#
# HOOKS INSTALLED:
# - pre-commit:  Enforces commit rules
# - commit-msg:  Validates commit message format
# - pre-push:    Validates commit history and runs detekt/tests
#
# USAGE:
#   ./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
#
# SAFETY:
# - Idempotent: Safe to run multiple times
# - Non-destructive: Overwrites existing hooks (they're git-ignored anyway)
# - Can be bypassed: Use --no-verify flag in emergencies

set -e  # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status
