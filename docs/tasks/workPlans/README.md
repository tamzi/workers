# Work Plans

Store temporary work plans here when a plan needs to be tracked separately.

## Usage

- Create a plan first, then derive tasks from it.
- Remove or archive plans after work completes.
- If `docs/tasks/` is missing, create it with this file and the work board templates.

## What to Capture

- Scope of the plan and why it exists.
- The ordered list of tasks derived from the plan.
- Dependencies, risks, and verification steps.
