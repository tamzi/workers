# Work To Be Done

Single source of truth for project tasks, priorities, and status. Completed work is recorded in
`workDone.md` in this directory.

## How to Use

- Create a plan first, then derive tasks from that plan.
- Keep tasks short, action-focused, and ordered by dependency.
- Use checkboxes and mark completed tasks with `[x]`.
- Work tasks in order unless the plan changes.
- Commit at the end of each task or logical unit per `docs/agentRules/commitRules.md`.
- At the end of each task, run a full build, assemble a debug build, and run the project to verify
  everything works.
- Never push; provide the command for a human to run.
 - If `docs/tasks/` is missing, create it with `workToBeDone.md`, `workDone.md`, and
   `workPlans/README.md`.

## What to Capture

- Current focus and the next most important epic.
- The ordered list of epics, stories, and tasks.
- Rationale for what is in Next Up versus Backlog.

## Current Focus

- (none)

## Next Up

- [ ] EPIC: 
  - [ ] STORY:

## Backlog
