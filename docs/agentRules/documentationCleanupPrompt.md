# Documentation Cleanup Prompt

Use this checklist when cleaning documentation:

- Remove code snippets and replace with links to real files.
- Remove duplicate or outdated sections.
- Ensure naming rules (camelCase) are followed.
- Update `docs/README.md` if any doc is added or removed.
- Keep module READMEs under 100 lines.
