# Documentation Rules

> **For AI Agents:** Documentation organization and structure guidelines

## Core Rules

1. Be concise and specific.
2. Keep docs in `docs/` (except module READMEs).
3. Module READMEs must be under 100 lines.
4. Use camelCase for markdown files, except `README.md` and `Agents.md`.
5. Update `docs/README.md` when adding new docs.
6. Do not include “Last Updated” dates or maintainer info.
7. No code snippets in markdown; link to real files instead.

## Organization

- High-level docs live in `docs/`.
- Detailed architecture docs go under `docs/architecture/`.
- Keep indexes current and accurate.

## Enforcement

- Verify naming and size limits before committing.
- Ensure all links reference real files.
