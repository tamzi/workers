# Coding Standards

> **For AI Agents:** Code style and conventions

## General Principles

- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Avoid duplicated logic; centralize shared behavior.

## Naming

- Use descriptive, domain-specific names.
- Avoid ambiguous abbreviations.
- Keep naming consistent within a module.

## Organization

- Group related files and keep module boundaries clear.
- Keep public APIs minimal and stable.
- Avoid circular dependencies.

## Documentation

- Public APIs require doc comments.
- Complex logic should include a short comment explaining why.
- TODOs must include a reason or a tracking reference.

## Formatting

- Use the repository’s formatter or lint rules.
- Keep line length reasonable for readability.
