# Testing Rules

> **For AI Agents:** Testing standards and practices

## Test Types

- Unit tests for pure logic
- Integration tests for component boundaries
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows (when applicable)

## Expectations

- Add tests for new behavior when feasible.
- Keep tests deterministic and independent.
- Prefer small, focused test cases.

## Running Tests

- Use the repo’s standard test command(s).
- If no standard exists, document what you ran in notes.

## Coverage

- Aim for meaningful coverage, not just high numbers.
- Prioritize critical logic and failure paths.
