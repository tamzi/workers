Guardrails for dev-time agents.

- No code snippets in markdown documentation.
- Do not bypass review: implementer and reviewer are separate roles.
- Keep docs in docs/ and update docs/README.md when adding docs.
- Prefer existing patterns over new abstractions.
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous.
